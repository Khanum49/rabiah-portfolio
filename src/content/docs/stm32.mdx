# Introduction

## What is ARM?

**ARM (Advanced RISC Machine)** is a semiconductor and software design company founded while searching for better processor performance. Unlike traditional chip manufacturers, ARM designs its own processor cores and chipsets (known as Intellectual Property or IP) and licenses these designs to other technology companies such as Apple, Huawei, Samsung, and many others.

This business model has made ARM architecture one of the most widely used processor architectures in the world, powering billions of devices from smartphones to embedded systems.

## ARM Cortex-M Series

**ARM Cortex-M** is a series of 32-bit ARM processor cores licensed by ARM developers specifically for microcontroller applications. These cores provide a foundation of instructions that microcontroller manufacturers can use as the basis for their specific designs.

### Key Characteristics
